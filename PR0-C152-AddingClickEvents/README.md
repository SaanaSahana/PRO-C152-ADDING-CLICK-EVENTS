Check index.html it has rocket structure Let’s start with <a-cone> for part1 and <a-cylinder> for part2. We can use <a-triangle> with vertex-a, vertex-b, vertex-c to set 3 different vertices. These 3 points will be in 3D. Remember how to write a component to move a box. We can write the same component for the shape we have drawn We can do that too, or we can apply it to the entire shape to move the shape altogether. Let’s apply the component to the entire shape. To do that, we should put all the parts under one entity. Great! Now, what can we do to simulate a scene similar to the launch? To do this we should be able to see the shape move upwards along the far view of the Earth as it goes higher and higher, right? Okay, let’s quickly create the sphere entity again for the Earth view. Great! Now let’s write the custom component to move the camera position. How can the position of the camera be changed to have a zoom-out effect? Let’s again write a component and add a window click event which will make the
